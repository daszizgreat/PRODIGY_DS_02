Title
Exploring Relationships and Patterns in the Titanic Dataset through Data Cleaning and EDA
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

In this project, I conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic, including demographic variables such as age, gender, ticket class, and survival status. The primary objective of this project was to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

The first step involved loading the dataset and performing data cleaning procedures. This included handling missing values by imputing median age for missing age values and dropping rows with missing values in other columns such as "Embarked" for simplicity.

Following data cleaning, I proceeded with exploratory data analysis to uncover insights from the dataset. Visualizations such as count plots and histograms were used to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns. For example, I examined the relationship between survival and passenger class, gender, and age.

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into factors that may have influenced survival rates among Titanic passengers. The findings from the data exploration process provide a deeper understanding of the demographics and characteristics of passengers aboard the Titanic and contribute to the broader understanding of this historical event.
